# Portfolio 1

## Description
This [python file](Portfolio1_MXS170018_4395.001.py) takes in a text file that holds data of a person
I.E First name, Last Name, Middle Initial, Person ID, and Phone number

and it parses the data so that it can be cleaned and rectified
afterwards it is puts the data into a dictionary and then 
pickles and unpickles it before printing the modified data

## Running
run the python file with the path for the datafile as an argument

## Python word processing
This is my first time using python for word processing and it hit me hard
to find out that strings are immutable in python, so I couldn't modify a string at an index
what was interesting though was the usage of RegEx. Generally, it took me longer to use python
than it would have taken me to use Java, but I am going to chalk it up to inexperience

## Reflection
I had also never used RegEx before, but i found it enticing. it will be a very useful addition to my toolkit. 
I learned how to apply some basic python fundamentals. It's hard getting used to not having every variable 
be declared as a certain type. Everything was new to me, but I enjoyed it.
