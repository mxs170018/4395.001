# Web Crawler

## Description
This [python file](WebCrawler.py) which takes in 2 George Washington related URLS and crawls on them to find relevant URLS. Afterwards it scrapes the text and processes it and outputs to a file. Then it creates a knowledge base on 10 relevant frequent words where each word has a list of correlated sentences. It pickles the knowledge base for usage on another program. There is also a [report](KnowledgeBase.pdf) that details how the Knowledge base was created, the contents of the knowledge base, as well as a sample interaction with a chat bot built on the knowledge base

## Running
run the python file with an internet connection
