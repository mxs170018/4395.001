## Employee Parse
You can see the [folder here](EmployeeParse) which holds a text file with employee information, and a python file that takes in the text file that holds it parses the data so that it can be cleaned and rectified afterwards it is puts the data into a dictionary and then pickles and unpickles it before printing

## Exploring NLTK

you can see the [python notebook](4395.001-Portfolio2-MXS170018.ipynb) which demonstrates some of the NLTK functionality

## Guessing Game
you can see the [folder here](GuessingGame) which holds a text file with a chapter from an anatomy text book and a python file that takes in a path to a text file. This program preprocess the text and displays its lexical diversity. It then isolates the 50 most frequent nouns for a guessing game.

## Word Net
you can see a walkthrough of NTLK's Wordnet in the [pdf here](WordNet.pdf)

## Language prediction with N-Grams
you can see the [folder here](Language_prediciton_with_N-Grams) which holds two files that work together to create a unigram and bigram occurence dictionary on the language corpa provided which is then used to predict whether a given text is of the languages provided

## Web Crawler: George Washington
you can see the [folder here](WebCrawler) which takes in 2 George Washington related URLS and crawls on them to find relevant URLS. Afterwards it scrapes the text and processes it and outputs to a file. Then it creates a knowledge base on 10 relevant frequent words where each word has a list of correlated sentences. It pickles the knowledge base for usage on another program
